Current target of this project is to build a simple 3d modelling and rendering tool.
Key idea is that the tool is mostly GUI free (mouse can be still used for mouse
picking and moving objects etc but there will be no typical GUI with buttons etc).
Everything is done with commands, similar to Vi/Emacs text editors, while keys can be bound to arbitrary commands.

At the moment development focuses on implementing basic 3d modelling operations.
